CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

Express HTML
  - Reloads pages frequently and less dynamic.
  - When combined with Angular becomes more dynamic and requires less page reloads.
JavaScript
  - Allows for interactive and dynamic design.
Single-Page Application (SPA)
  - Angular is the framework we used in this application to create an SPA
  - Offers a better user experience by minimizing the page reloads utilizing an interactive UI that can update without reloading.
  
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
 - MongoDB is flexible in its data management and compatibility, scalable, and performs well in general.

Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

JSON

Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
